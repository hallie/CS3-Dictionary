In this folder, you have a text document that I found online containing a
bunch of dictionary words (1). Because they weren't arranged in a way that I
felt would be easy to organize in my C++ code, I wrote a python script (3)
that uses regular expressions to separate the words from their definitions.

Because there were so many words, I figured it would be all for the best
to only rewrite a fraction of the words to the text file (2) that the C++
side will ultimately read, just for the sake of not wasting time during
the presentation.

Files:
1. "Full text of  Webster's Unabridged Dictionary .txt"
2. "Dictionary.txt"
3. "organize.py"
